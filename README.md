# Pomelo (Yuzu)

Based on Bunjs, Pomelo is a resource parsing tool with flexible configurations. It supports various types of resources. Most of the functionality is inspired by [Flexget](https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget).

A typical use case is parsing RSS resources and sending them to aria2 for download.
