# pomelo (Yuzu)

Based on Bun/Nodejs, pomelo is a resource parsing tool with flexible configurations. It supports various types of resources. Most of the functionality is inspired by [Flexget](https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget).

A typical use case involves parsing RSS resources and sending them to aria2 for downloading. This process is particularly suitable when paired with [Aria2 Pro](https://github.com/P3TERX/Aria2-Pro-Docker).
